# Dixa Enteprise technical assignment

First off, welcome to Dixa Enterprise's technical assignment.
The assignment is meant to be a conversation starter for the technical interviewing phase for software engineers considered for the Dixa enterprise team.

## There are two options for submitting this assignment.

A. If you already have a portfolio project or OSS contribution activity that accurately demonstrates your technical ability for the role, you are welcome to submit that.

B. Fork this repository and follow the instructions below...

### NodeJs API

1. Setup a node.js application to host an http server
2. Create an API using an API first approach. The API must have basic CRUD functionality over a self chosen resource. The API should be functional and interact with a database of your own choice.
3. Document and test your solution. Explain what it does, how to use it, and what changes or additions you would make if you had more time to work on it. 

If you are having trouble coming up with an idea or scoping it, we are here to help. We don't expect that you spend more than a few hours over a period of one week to prepare your submission.

## What we are looking for in your submissions

- creativity 
- code readability 
- commit history 
- documentation 
- testability 
- efficiency 
- reliability 

Trade-offs are expected between these categories. A very creative solution might not be super efficient or as well tested as a simpler idea. Nonetheless, be prepared to discuss these topics during our technical interview.

## What we are NOT looking for in your submissions
- 100% test coverage 
- Everything to be documented 
- Perfectly scoped commits with super detailed descriptions 
- A full featured integration product 

Remember that we are not looking for perfect in your submissions. All we are looking for is a sample of your work that we can use to start a conversation. So, do submit your solution as soon as you feel like you have demonstrated how you would approach implementing such integration solutions. If we like what we see, you will have plenty of time to tell us how you would go about improving it during our technical interview :)
